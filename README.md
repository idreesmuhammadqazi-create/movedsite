Site Has Moved: Simple Redirect Landing PageThis repository provides a minimal, single-file landing page designed to inform users and search engines that your website has permanently moved to a new domain or URL structure. It is ideal for quick site migrations where you need to maintain continuity and SEO value.Key FeaturesSingle File Deployment: The entire solution is contained within a single index.html file for easy deployment.Automatic Redirection: Uses a standard HTML <meta http-equiv="refresh"> tag to redirect users after a short, configurable delay.Clear User Notification: Provides a visible message, including a direct link, in case the automatic redirect fails or is blocked.SEO Best Practice Placeholder: This page should be served with a HTTP 301 (Permanent Redirect) status code by your server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx) for maximum SEO benefit. The client-side refresh tag serves as a fallback for the user experience.ConfigurationTo use this page, you only need to update one key variable inside the index.html file:Set the New URL: Locate the following line in the <head> section and replace [YOUR_NEW_URL] with the full URL of your new website:<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=[YOUR_NEW_URL]">

Example: content="5;url=https://www.mynewsite.com"Configure Redirect Delay (Optional): The number 5 in the content attribute sets the delay in seconds before redirection. You can change this:content="0;..." for an immediate redirect (less user-friendly).content="10;..." for a longer delay.Update the Visible Link: For accessibility, ensure the visible link in the body matches the new URL:<p class="text-xl mt-4">
  If you are not redirected automatically, please follow this link:
  <a href="[YOUR_NEW_URL]" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">
    [YOUR_NEW_URL]
  </a>
</p>

Deployment Recommendations (Critical for SEO)While the HTML handles the user experience, the server must communicate the permanence of the move to search engines.Before deploying this file, ensure your server is configured to serve this page with an HTTP Status Code of 301 Moved Permanently.If you are using a standard web host, you would typically:Upload the modified index.html file to the root of the old domain.Configure your hosting control panel or .htaccess file to explicitly send a 301 status for all requests to the old domain, pointing them to this page.Failing to use a 301 status code may result in a loss of search ranking value.
